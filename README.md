# Decission-Tree

Decision Tree Hands-on
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates the process of building and evaluating a decision tree classifier using the scikit-learn library in Python. The notebook covers data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation steps.

Notebook Overview
The notebook includes the following sections:

Import Libraries: Importing the necessary libraries for data manipulation, model training, and evaluation.
Load Data: Loading the dataset used for training and testing the model.
Preprocessing: Preparing the data by splitting it into training and testing sets.
Training Models with Different Depths: Training multiple decision tree models with varying depths to find the optimal depth.
Best Model Selection: Selecting the best model based on accuracy and retraining it.
Accuracy of the Model: Evaluating the accuracy of the best model.
Results
The best decision tree model achieved an accuracy of 84.9% on the test set with a tree depth of 7.
